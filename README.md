# BLOODWAVE
#MadeWithDefold game jam entry, very much unfinished.


Sound effects and music have been removed, as they do not fall under the license.

Sound objects have been re-directed to an included "empty_sound.wav" file as a quick fix so the game should still build without complaint.

The game files include:

Defluid:
